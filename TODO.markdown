### KNOWN ISSUES ###

* The synchronizer will enter an infinite loop when launching a task on a server with authentication failure.
* Dialogs only show a black screen when split-view is disabled on the iPad (mail public key / mail console log).

### WISHLIST ###

* Use QuickView to show files that are known to not be editable.
